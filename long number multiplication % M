I know the following hack for calculating A*B mod M. 
Let's calculate res=A*B in long long, forget about overflow.
Then we calculate tmp=round(A*B/M) in long double and subtract tmp*M from res.
If long double doesn't give a huge error (it doesn't, but double does), 
we just got read from overflowing (because all we need is error in tmp less than 9). So, return res % M;
